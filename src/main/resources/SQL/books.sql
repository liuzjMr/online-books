Heidiland, a theme park, is one of the big attractions in Zurich.\n\nHeidi The Girl from the Alps by Swiss children\'s author Johanna Spyri was published in two parts in 1880. It tells of Heidi, a little Swiss girl whose parents\' sudden death leaves her to be brought up by her aunt. Aunt Dete is a career-woman who though she loves Heidi, does not have the time or resources to look after a child in busy Frankfurt. She leaves Heidi with Heidi\'s grandfather, who lives in the Swiss mountains. The lonely, embittered old man lives like a hermit on the mountain-top and has nothing to do with the people in the village below. Known to all as “Alm-uncle” Heidi\'s grandfather is good-hearted but mistrustful of the villagers. He refuses to send Heidi to school and allows her to roam the pastures with a young goat herder, Peter. They become good friends but events take a turn when Aunt Dete decides that Heidi must stay in Frankfurt and learn to earn a living.\n\nShe is employed as a companion to a rich invalid child, Clara, and soon learns to read and write along with the little girl. The city begins to take its toll on the young Heidi and she becomes ill and depressed. How Heidi returns to her beloved mountains, reforms her crotchety old grandfather and helps Clara regain her health forms the rest of this delightful story.\n\nThis unassuming and easy to read book remains fresh and unspoiled, still receiving an enthusiastic response throughout the world. Generations of kids have enjoyed reading about the naïve and spontaneous Heidi, the mischievous Peter, the bitter and lonely Alm-uncle, the strict and authoritarian housekeeper Fraulein Rottenmeier, the long-suffering Clara and Clara\'s kind and gracious grandmother Frau Sesemann.\n\nThis sweet and charming story earned eternal fame for its shy, retiring author who endured several personal tragedies and wrote many other pleasing stories, but none so famous as Heidi, The Girl from the Alps.');

Later, it was published in book form and won acclaim from critics and readers across the world for its wonderful elements of character and plot.\n\nEdith Nesbit the author published more than sixty books during her long and illustrious career as a children\'s writer. She was considered to be the first modern children\'s writer and departed from the hitherto focus on fantasy and fairytale type of themes that were considered suitable for children. Apart from writing for children, she wrote several novels for adults. She also dabbled in poetry, horror fiction and collaborations with other writers. Her works include another famous book, The Secret Garden which also explores the childhood landscape and influenced generations of children\'s writers. She was also a political activist and laid the foundations for the present Labor Party in England. Her dominant themes were children in real life settings, contemporary events, children\'s encounters with the mysterious and often nefarious activities of grown-ups, a deep psychological insight into the mind of a child and the enduring love of nature, family relationships and the simple pleasures of countryside life.\n\nThe story opens with the description of three little Londoners who enjoy an ordinary, peaceful life in the city with visits to the Zoo and Madame Tussauds. They have a charming, well-appointed home and loving parents. Things take a sudden turn for the worst when Father suddenly leaves after receiving mysterious “bad news.” Mother decides equally suddenly to move with the children to the country-side and here begins their adventure with the railways. They befriend a strange Old Gentleman who invariably travels on the 9.15 train from near their home and get drawn into bizarre and dangerous events.\n\nSaid to be based on contemporary events such as the Dreyfus Affair, Russian dissidents who were fighting the Tsarist regime and the circumstances leading up to World War I, The Railway Children though ostensibly written for children certainly appeals to readers of all ages. It has been adapted extensively for radio, stage, television and screen and has retained its freshness and thrill over the hundred plus years since it first made its debut.');

One of the challenges that writers of history face is about fleshing out the characters and making the bland repetition of dates and dynasties seem relevant to modern day readers. Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall was a British writer who wrote several children\'s books. Her most famous work is Our Island Story, a book of British history, which was considered to be the definitive children\'s history of Britain for more than half a century. However, some of Marshall\'s books may be found to be historically inaccurate, racially biased and often rely on mythology, legend and even Shakespeare as the source of material.\n\nThis Country of Ours was published in the UK in 1917 and later was also reissued as The Story of the United States in 1919. It begins with a brief account of the Vikings and how they were the people who really discovered America, before the advent of Columbus. The story of Columbus and his famous expedition are thrillingly recounted along with stories of the English and French explorers who also sailed to the New World. New England, the Middle and Southern Colonies, the American War of Independence, the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln, the abolition of Slavery and finally the coming of World War I where the book ends make up the rest of the story.\n\nApart from children, adults will also find it interesting to skim through as many of us have forgotten the details of our history lessons learned in school. Another important aspect is that This Country of Ours was written at a time when it was still fashionable to be patriotic! Today, we are so accustomed to having our great leaders\' lives ripped open to public scrutiny and very few of them have survived the onslaught of scandal and the loss of personal reputation. This Country of Ours takes us back to a more innocent era when the great figures of history were still role models for children to be emulated.\n\nAs a general overview of American History, This Country of Ours is indeed a good book to read.');

This marks the beginning of a life-changing experience for Pip.\n\nMiss Havisham is a wealthy eccentric whose twisted agenda is that of taking revenge on the man who jilted her at the altar. Pip is unwittingly drawn into her malevolent schemes. When Pip grows older, Miss Havisham\'s lawyer Mr Jaggers informs Pip that he has come into a large fortune from an unknown benefactor and that he must move to London and learn to become a “gentleman.” What follows is a strange and labyrinthine tale of Pip\'s journey into adulthood.');

With the aid of this material, he plans to explore space and wants to undertake an experimental journey to the moon. Bedford is excited by this and immediately sees the commercial value of Cavorite. Together the two launch into a moon voyage. However when they get there, they discover that the moon is not an uninhabited satellite as was hitherto assumed. What follows is classic sci-fi with a twist of romance.\n\nScholars have dubbed The First Men in the Moon as the first alien dystopia, where the denizens of another world are hostile to humans. The book probably launched a whole new genre of sci-fi horror fiction and has had a huge influence on films, TV, stage, animation, video-games and comics. It has been adapted to film four times. A scandal erupted when Wells was accused of plagiarism by an Irish writer, but no evidence was found for the charges.\n\nThough modern-day readers may find some of the scientific concepts quaint and outdated, the plot and characters more than make up for any such shortcomings.\n\nA great read for young and old alike!');

So, Carthoris finds himself in quite the plight as his love appears to be both impossible and unrequited.

Adding new intriguing elements and twists to the familiar setting of Mars, Burroughs continues to delight science fiction enthusiasts.\n\nThe planetary romance offers a slower pace of action than its predecessors, therefore allowing Burroughs the opportunity to efficiently employ descriptive language to add more detail to life on the Red Planet.

Currently, the slot of Thursday is vacant and Gregory is a strong contender for the post. The rest of the story describes how Syme is drawn into the group and uncovers some of its deepest and most incredible secrets.

Since then, the book has been adapted for radio readings and a film was also planned based on the book, though it wasn\'t made. The appeal of the book lies in its extremely readable style, exciting twists and turns of plot, memorable characters and the lyrical descriptions of Edwardian London.\n\nFor die-hard Chesterton fans, this would be a great new addition to their list, while those whose good fortune it is to encounter Chesterton for the first time in this novel will certainly enjoy the experience!');
