# Online Book Project Presentation

**Good morning/afternoon, everyone,**

I’m very happy to share my **Online Book Project** with you today. This project gives people an easy way to read books online and listen to audio, while also having a simple management system for administrators.

---

## What is the project about?
The platform has two main parts:
1. A **user interface** for reading and listening to books.
2. A **backend system** for managing the books.

---

## What can users do?
Users can:
- **Read books** online, like children’s stories, science fiction .
- **Listen to audio** for each chapter. 

This is very helpful for kids and people learning a new language.

---

## What can administrators do?
Administrators can:
- Add, edit, or delete books and chapters.
- Manage the library easily to keep it updated.

---

## What technology does it use?
- The **backend** uses Spring Data JPA and MySQL to store and manage data.
- The **frontend** uses Thymeleaf and Bootstrap to make the pages look clean.

---

## What makes it special?
1. **Audio + Text Sync**  
   Users can read and listen at the same time, making learning and reading more fun.

2. **Easy Management**  
   Admins can organize books with just a few clicks.

---

## Why is this project useful?
This platform combines reading and listening, making reading more fun and helpful for different people. The backend system also helps keep the library organized.

---

## What’s next?
In the future, I want to:
- Improve the sync between audio and text.
- Add more types of books to attract more users.

**Thank you** for listening. If you have questions, I’m happy to answer them!
